# Welcome to the Barriers in NLP github Page
This repo is intended as the main entry point to the survey on barriers in NLP.

## What is the survey about?
The survey is intended to gather information about what are the current perceived barriers in NLP and how these barriers are affecting researchers from different regions of the NLP community.

## Instructions
Filling any part of the survey is completely optional so that at any point you may leave the survey. We are providing translations to a few languages so feel free to select the link to the survey for the language that you feel more comfortable using for this purpose.
If none of the small list of languages in here is appropriate, you can answer the open ended questions in the language of your choice, we will take care of the translation for the analysis purpose.
