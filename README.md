The survey is intended to gather information about what are the current perceived barriers in NLP and how these barriers are affecting researchers from different regions of the NLP community.

## Instructions

Filling any part of the survey is completely optional so that at any point you may leave the survey. We are providing translations to a few languages so feel free to select the link to the survey for the language that you feel more comfortable using for this purpose.
